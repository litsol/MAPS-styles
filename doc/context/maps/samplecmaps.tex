    \startAbstract
      Zaphod Beeblebrox, or the Big Z, was a former President of the
      Galaxy. He was born on the fifth planet of Betelgeuse and was a
      semi-cousin of Ford Prefect, with whom he shared three of the
      same mothers. Due to an accident with a contraceptive and a time
      machine, his direct ancestors from his father were also his
      direct descendants.

    \startsubject[title={Left Brain}]
      Zaphod has his second head (apparently the more intelligent one)
      detached and functioning as the Heart of Gold computer,
      replacing Eddie.[6] This leaves the still attached Zaphod a
      little slower witted but it is noted that Left Brain being in
      charge of the ship has decreased the amount of accidents that
      would have been caused by Eddie. Left Brain and Zaphod develop a
      semi-antagonistic relationship despite still working with each
      other. At the end of the novel they are both working on Zaphod's
      presidential re-election campaign. Ford was also able to freeze
      Left Brain in a logic debate over the improbability of the Heart
      of Gold saving him and Arthur from doom near Earth twice after
      the ship saves them from the Grebulon's death beams.

    \startsubject[title={Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster}]
      Zaphod is the inventor of the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster, a
      fictional cocktail based on Janx Spirit. The series describes
      the drink as "the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging - expensive
      and bad for the head" and states that the effect of one "is like
      having your brain smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round
      a large gold brick". In the television series, two Gargle
      Blaster drinkers collapse in open-eyed unconsciousness after
      drinking while the spilled drink burns a hole in the floor; in
      the film, after the Guide is done explaining what the
      Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster is and its effects, Ford and Zaphod
      yell in pain. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy gives the
      recipe as follows:

      \startitemize
        \item Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit.
        \item Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of
          Santraginus V
        \item Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the
          mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).
        \item Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through
          it (in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of
          pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia).
        \item Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of
          Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady
          odours of the dark Qualactin Zones.
        \item Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it
          dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian suns deep into
          the heart of the drink.
        \item Sprinkle Zamphuor.
        \item Add an olive.
        \item Drink\ldots but very carefully."
